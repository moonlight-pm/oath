# Progress model — how Oath documents itself

**Describing the system and its progress is first-class work.** Incomplete
meta work is incomplete product work. Any session that changes behavior,
capability maturity, dogfood/runtime state, or priority must update the
matching docs **in the same change** as the code.

**Portable practice (project-agnostic):**
[`progress-documentation-practice.md`](progress-documentation-practice.md)

**Session skills:**
[`.grok/skills/oath-session-start/SKILL.md`](../.grok/skills/oath-session-start/SKILL.md) ·
[`.grok/skills/oath-progress-docs/SKILL.md`](../.grok/skills/oath-progress-docs/SKILL.md)

## Four document kinds

Never mix “is” and “will be” in the same paragraph without an explicit label.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRODUCT DOCS (operator)     docs/manual/               │
│  Audience: people and agents running Oath.              │
│  Voice: “what you can do.” AS-SHIPPED only.             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AS-BUILT (engineering)      architecture + capabilities│
│  “What exists in code and on the dogfood machine.”      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TARGET (engineering)        specs + roadmap remaining  │
│  “What we decided; what’s still left.”                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FOCUS (session)             CURRENT.md only            │
│  Priority, next slice, runtime facts, locks             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Kind | Canonical home | Update when |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Root [`CURRENT.md`](../CURRENT.md) | Priority, next moves, or dogfood/runtime facts change |
| **As-built progress** | [`capabilities.md`](capabilities.md) | Capability status or gaps change |
| **As-built system map** | [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | Processes, trees, paths, image layout change |
| **Target design** | [`specs/`](specs/) freezes | Decisions lock or amend (**not** a changelog) |
| **Horizon** | [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) | Phase-level status flips only |
| **Open forks** | [`open-questions.md`](open-questions.md) | A fork opens or closes |
| **Parked** | [`ideas/`](ideas/) | Thought captured; promote later |
| **Implementation checklists** | [`plans/`](plans/) | Active slice only; at most one open plan |
| **Product / operator docs** | [`manual/`](manual/) | **Shipped** (or honestly limited) operator-visible behavior |
| **History** | [`../apocrypha/`](../apocrypha/) | Never authoritative |

### Authority order

1. **Code that ships** (and tests)
2. **Root `CURRENT.md`** for active priority and live dogfood/runtime facts
3. **`docs/capabilities.md`** for capability maturity
4. **This `docs/` suite** for intent and map
5. **`apocrypha/`** — history / reference only

**Code wins over stale docs** — then fix the docs immediately.

---

## Capability status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning | Product docs (`docs/manual/`) may say? |
|--------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| **shipped** | In code; dogfoodable | **Yes** — as fact |
| **partial** | Scaffold or subset; **gaps must be listed** | Only with honest limits |
| **spec’d** | Freeze exists; little or no code | **No** |
| **planned** | On roadmap; no freeze yet | **No** |
| **idea** | [`ideas/`](ideas/) only | **No** |

**Partial without listed gaps is invalid.**

Roadmap phases may use `done` / `partial` / `active` / `next` / `planned` /
`unplanned`. Capabilities are the day-to-day truth for agents.

---

## Spec freeze headers

Active freezes under `docs/specs/` should open with:

```markdown
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** target (freeze)
**Implementation:** shipped | partial | not started
**Dogfood:** none | QEMU | …
**Gaps:** (bullets or “none for v0”)
**As-built:** [../capabilities.md](../capabilities.md) · [../architecture.md](../architecture.md)
```

- Freezes stay **normative desired shape** — not progress trackers.
- Prefer date-prefixed filenames.
- New implementation checklists go under `docs/plans/`.
- At most **one** open plan for the active slice.

---

## Product docs rule (hard)

[`docs/manual/`](manual/) documents **working, operator-visible behavior only**.

| Capability status | Product docs |
|-------------------|--------------|
| shipped | Document as fact |
| partial | Omit, or document only what works, labeled limited |
| spec’d / planned / idea | Do not present as product fact |

Engineering desire lives in specs + roadmap + capabilities — not the manual.

The *running OS* will eventually carry its own live catalog for agents. That
catalog is product, and must also describe **what is actually there**. The
repo manual is the development-time twin, not a second story.

---

## `CURRENT.md` is a dashboard

**Keep:** Now (3–7 next moves), known dogfood/runtime state, locked models,
pointers, short ops notes.

**Do not grow into:** full phase inventory, long ship history, design essays.

**No second living handoff.** Forbidden as living truth:

- Parallel `STATUS.md` / `HANDOFF.md` / session diaries
- Duplicating priority into `.grok/rules/active-work.md` (that file is a
  **pointer** only)
- Living “review findings” trees

Absorb findings into capabilities + active plan + open-questions, then delete
the duplicate.

---

## Open questions

[`open-questions.md`](open-questions.md) holds **unresolved design forks**, not
the implementation backlog.

1. **Decision points (ask human)** — `D1`, `D2`, … agents must not invent
2. **Open technical questions** — still design, not policy ownership
3. **Decision log** — when answered: date, decision, pointer

---

## Session loop

### Start

1. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)
2. [`CURRENT.md`](../CURRENT.md)
3. [`capabilities.md`](capabilities.md) — rows for the slice
4. [`open-questions.md`](open-questions.md) — any D* for this slice?
5. One freeze or plan if building that domain
6. Architecture only if needed

### End (same change as code)

1. Capability row(s)
2. CURRENT if priority/dogfood changed
3. Product manual if operator-visible shipped behavior changed
4. architecture if system map changed
5. Freeze header if implementation status moved
6. roadmap only if phase-level flip
7. open-questions if a fork opened/closed or D* answered

Skipping capability / CURRENT / product-doc updates while shipping behavior is
a **process failure**.

### Before claiming “done”

- Capability rows reflect new truth
- CURRENT reflects new priority/dogfood if either changed
- Product docs updated if operator-facing shipped behavior changed
- Tests/format appropriate to the code change

## Project defaults

| Default | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Product vs host | Tools used to produce images are not the installed OS. The artifact is Oath. |
| Implementation | Do not start kernel/package/installer trees until the first freeze exists. Time is not a reason for throwaway architecture (no wrap-dinit, no foreign init). |
| Init | We own PID 1 + supervisor. Service config is the catalog. |
| License | MIT. [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE). |
| One ontology | When in doubt, add a typed object and a catalog page, not a new config format. |
| Catalog | `/oath`. Identity `kind:name`. `oath` is the only admin surface. |

---

## Deferred meta work

| Item | Why deferred | When to revisit |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| CI that fails if shipped capability has no manual page | Manual discipline first | After matrix has shipped rows |
| Generate architecture diagram from the image | Hand map is enough | After a QEMU image exists |
| Live catalog generated from repo specs | No catalog yet | When the object model freezes |

Do not use this table as a second product tracker.
